Recursion : a method that calls itself.
        : we need stopping condition 
        : we need recursive call 

Anology : how many people are in front of me?

what's the least amount i can do?
when would the process complete? what's my stopping condition?

what is the base case?
what is the smallest amount of work I can do  in each iteration?


a function that calls itself
call stack - when a function is invoked is placed on top. When function ends its removed from the top 
Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach the base case
base case: where the recursion stops - recursions always need a "return"
